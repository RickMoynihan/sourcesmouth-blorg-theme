** TODO Network Lib or AOL 2.0?



http://daggle.com/070810-212637.html

Since the 2004 Web 2.0 conference, we've seen lots of hyperbole and
repositioning as people proclaim themselves and their vested intests
as being the future of the web.

further ahead of the curve than anyone else about Web 3.0 will be.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/21/email_future/

- Web 2.0 was the web as platform, but we really need to use the
  internet as platform again.
- Just as telephony, interactive tv and microsoft office are evolving
  to support web-styled interactions.  One day the web will need to
  evolve to align itself with another system.  -- Perhaps a comment
  for a different post.
- Semantic web is never going to take off big and fulfill it's vision.
- Nobody's got a scooby what Web 3.0 will be about
  - Semantic web folk just assumed it requires semantics of an RDF
    variety... bullshit!  People find it hard enough to write valid
    HTML, and the overall validity of XML feeds is shit.
- Email is overloaded
- The rise of social networks is not the answer
  + Centralised
  + Lock in
  + Inefficient
- Email did a lot of things well
  + CC, BCC, Mailing lists etc...
  + P2P (YAY!)
  + Message based
- Our social networks and the "Social Graph" are often well
  represented (or can easily be seeded) via email address books.
- Email needs 'enterprise' workflow features
  + Sending simple forms to people...
  + Expression of protocols, e.g. auction, message-response etc...
  + Integration of 'business rules' into mail clients
  + Should support M2M, H2M & H2H
    - M2M messages should include 'friend' updates
- Ability to browse mail boxes
- Needs good security
- Perhaps RIA platforms will prove good for bringing web-style
  innovation to the client end, which is what Email 2.0 needs.
- Email 2.0 may actually better be IM 2.0, I'm not sure.
- Big problem is how do you evolve a large P2P and standards based
  system and ensure interoperability?

** TODO Software Installation - WTF!?

Common criticism of linux is software installation sucks.

- Software installation on Windows (often) sucks more.
- Microsoft haven't unified software installation on windows.
- Linux distro's are often very good at application installation (if it's in the repo).

- Windows is a mess because of automated updates
  + Each non MS program needs to reinvent the installer/updater wheel,
    causing instability and constant updates and frustration.
  + Linux is far saner here.

** TODO Communication Interaction Matrix 

- Hard Copy Book
- Newspaper
- Television          
- Radio               
- Telephone Call      
- Conference Call     
- Voicemail           
- SMS                 
- Email               
- Email MailingList   
- I/M                 
- Skype               
- IRC                 
- Usenet              
- Website             
- Web Forum (no Feed) 
- Wiki

** TODO Bar Camp Leeds                              :computing:barcampleeds:tv3:

Well, I'm a little ashamed of myself for taking so long to getting
around to writing about it, but damn was [[http://barcamp.org/BarCampLeeds][Bar Camp Leeds]] fun!
[[http://www.techiedog.com/blog/tdogblog.html][Techie dog]] had come up from Huddersfield earlier in the week to do
some hacking on a hush hush project, allowing us to spend a good few
days synchronising our development.  Everything went swimmingly,
despite some minor provisioning issues with the [[http://www.flexiscale.com/][Flexiscale]] virtual
servers, which are now proving to be a real [[http://www.amazon.com/b%3Fie%3DUTF8&node%3D201590011][EC2]] beater.

On the Friday, scarcely a few hours before our train, [[http://ceoblog.calicojack.co.uk/][Paul]] and I
received our much anticipated delivery from [[http://sourcesmouth.co.uk/blog/Forget-the-Linux-Desktop-it-s-the-Linux-Laptop-that-matters.html][Asus]].  Despite the time
pressure it was a doddle to get the thing connected to the net and add
the [[http://www.debian.org/][Debian]] repository required to install [[http://www.debian.org/][Emacs]].

Paul and I met up with Techie Dog the following morning and made our way to 
[[http://www.leedsmet.ac.uk/the_news/feb06/bbc.htm][Old Broadcasting House]]; which was not only the venue for [[http://barcampleeds.com/][Bar camp]] but also a
newly refurbished incubator providing excellent [[http://coworking.pbwiki.com/][co-working]]
facilities and the beginnings of great small business community!  It's fair to say I was
more than a little jealous and can't help think that Dundee and
[[http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/tayside/][SET]] should employ [[http://imran.typepad.com/blog/][Imran]] and crew to help deliver upon the promises of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_glen][Silicon Glen]].  

Following being greeted by a [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/greensontour/2044261494/][Polaroid]] (I'm on the far left on the middle
row) for the [[photo%20wall][photo wall]], [[http://www.thomasscott.net/][Tom]] kicked things off with an enthusiastic
intro and a brief explanation of the days format (4 tracks with half
hour sessions).  

After pondering the board for sessions I decided to start by attending
[[http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/2007/11/18/sailes-tv-3/][Mark Sailes]] TV 3.0.  True to the adhocratic nature of bar camp Mark
simply posited his idea about audience participation over shared
annotations, commentary and edits; and let his audience discuss it,
resulting in a good round table discussion (see [[http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/2007/11/18/sailes-tv-3/][Simon Wheatley's write up]]).

After being a [[http://del.icio.us/InkyHarmonics/jonudell][follower]] and fan of [[http://jonudell.net/][Jon Udell]]'s insightful work for
several years, I've long felt frustrated by the hypermedia experience
which at best can only really be described as a media experience.
Mark's discussion's reaffirmed me of the belief that the two biggest
holes in the web are audio and video files which ([[http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/07/18/primetime.html][almost]]) defy
granular hyperlinking and random access.  Until they do however, what
are we to do to deliver on Mark's grand vision?  Well the
[[http://participatoryculture.org/][Participatory Culture Foundation]]'s [[http://www.fsf.org/][free]] and open-source [[http://getmiro.com/][Miro]] platform
is an ambitious project to democratise online video by seperating the
place people watch and host videos online.  In my mind though it would
do well to support the more participatory features Mark had in mind. 

[[http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/01/07/primetime.html][Jon says]] no player supports the required features: 
- HTTP 1.1 random access
- Seek/jump to offset
- Precise cursor control
- Selection marking and review, with precise adjustment of segment boundaries
- Export in/out times



 When these [[http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wilde-text-fragment-09.txt][and other]]
formats eventually become first class citizens of the web, it will
have evolved enough for Tim O'Reilly to bless it Web(/TV) 3.0.



From my perspective

** Google Search trivia...

The Google search for "innovation" surprisingly puts the DTI's
department for business enterprise and regulatory form at #1.

http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=innovation

The most innovative thing here is wikipedia =)

It's also no coincidence that these two things are often the same
thing.


it's the innovations that disrupt
the status quo


the kinds that don't cost lots of money

There are two kinds of innovation, the kind that costs lots of money
and the kind that doesn't.

I've always enjoyed innovation and technology, but it always seems to
be the innovations on the edges that excite me the most.

innovation on the edge and at the
fringes is best!  

 I'll follow with an even sillier ; but spending billions on a large
hadron collider

it's the innovations which
make things affordable and


take on the incumbants and come from real human need that are best.

 I enjoy
seeing the most.


Not only are the
stories about the 2 guys who changed the world

 Large Hadron
Collider with

It's often nice to witness innovation, disruptive technologies and
revolutions on the boil.  

and disruptive technologies

have
always interested me, but the innovations I like seeing the most tend
to be where the constraints have been set really tight.

 
indeed it's a significant part of what led me to Linux and the Free
and Open Source Source software movements.  

Disruptive technologies and revolutions almost always come from the
edge.  Indeed it almost seems to be part of the definition

** TODO On Personal Publishing

Write about the rise of blogging...  And how blogging isn't just about
flamewars and opinion (for that there's usenet ;)) it's a convenient
publishing platform, that doesn't have to be used for public discussion.

** TODO Write about and research Thunderbird & Future of email
** TODO BBC IPlayer DRM, Net Neutrality and P2P

http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070813-isps-to-bbc-we-throttle-iplayer-unless-you-pay-up.html

If the BBC would adopt bittorrent and allow free distribution of their
content then ISP's might find it harder to throttle them.

** TODO Network Lib - Web 2.0 is thermal noise	     :web:internet:freesoftware:
** TODO Benefits of Free Software / Open Source

Freedom is not just freedom of choice.

- Free Software carries with it a free market for support and services.
- Free Software allows developers to work openly and create a public portfolio of work.

** TODO RIA & MS

Rich internet Apps are generating a lot of interest just now.
Microsoft, Adobe, Java and AJAX are all competing against each other,
but so is Mozilla.

http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/15/1620255&from=rss

Silverlight is dangerous because Microsoft will leverage it in a
battle against Google and indexable documents.

- RIA should be more than just better graphics and UI's, it
  represents.  It should provide integration with things that can ONLY
  be done on the client, e.g. interacting with devices etc...
- GWT & Java..

computing should be done, and includes all that is important.

After making this decision about 6 months ago, I quickly decided that
I didn't want to use Wordpress.  Wordpress is a wonderful piece of
software, but I anticipated that my main problem would be motivating
myself to write content.  For me the chore of logging into a webpage
to enter text into a HTML textarea or evenn using a javascript
imitiation of a rich text control would mean that I'd likely not
bother to write content.  

After investigating some Ruby based static blogging tools such as
Hobix and Rassmalog I discovered blorg and org-blog

** Freedom at the end of the (ZX) Spectrum

At around the same time a man named [[http://www.philzimmermann.com/][Phil Zimmermann]] was being
persecuted by the US government as an international arms dealer.  His
crime, writing a free privacy tool known as Pretty Good Privacy, or
PGP.  Fortunately Eben Moglen now with [[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39257499,00.htm][successfully defended him.]]

Maybe Ted Nelson got Dream Machines and Computer Lib the wrong way
round.  Perhaps Dream machines should have been the history of
computers etc, whilst Computer Lib should have been about the network
and Xanadu, which is the real architecture for liberation.

importantly freedom.  Describe Eben Moglens spat with Tim OReilly...

** Forget the Linux Desktop, it's the Linux Laptop that's important

Microsoft not as good at creating distributions as the Linux
community.  Will inevitably end up trying to target a lot of areas and
specialised devices.  MS not good at making OS's, but good at bundling
software and maintaining a monopoly.  Will probably get out of the OS
business and do what Apple did...

For me the EEEPC if successful will be an important landmark on this
route.

This is a role that Linux is well placed to serve, yet Desktop Windows
isnt.

It's widely known that Microsoft's OEM practices have prevented many
manufacturers from offering alternatives to their customers.  

It seems that the cost of
hardware has fallen so low that Microsoft can no longer reasonably
charge so much for what is a commodity.

 worry space which Microsoft can't easily target.  The reason, because users
buying £200 laptops don't want to spend hundreds on operating systems
and basic office software.

This prospect has already clearly scared Microsoft, who just [[http://members.forbes.com/global/2007/1112/024a.html][prior to
release] decided to offer Eee PC owners the option of buying it with
Windows for an extra $40, but does this include Office?

 compete without

  I can't help but feel that this laptop is a harbinger

 and it'll be a lot of peoples first experience of desktop Linux.

But it gets even better as MS got spooked at it giving Linux an edge
had to lower the price of Windows.

Flash memory's been cheap enough for a long time and Linux has always
been able to run like a dream on lowend hardware.
